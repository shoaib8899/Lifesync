### LifeSync

An all-in-one assistant for habits, health, and productivity.

-----

### 🎯 The Problem

In today's fast-paced world, individuals often struggle to manage their well-being. The market is saturated with countless separate applications for tracking habits, monitoring health metrics, and managing productivity. This forces users to juggle multiple apps, leading to fragmented data, a cluttered digital life, and ultimately, a breakdown in their well-being routines.

### 💡 Our Solution: LifeSync

LifeSync is a unified, all-in-one assistant designed to seamlessly integrate a user's habits, health, and productivity into a single, intuitive platform. We believe that true well-being comes from a holistic approach, and our application is built from the ground up to reflect that philosophy.

### ✨ Features

  * **Habit Tracker:** Easily create, manage, and track daily habits with a simple interface.
  * **Health Dashboard:** View a consolidated dashboard of your health metrics (e.g., water intake, sleep, activity).
  * **Productivity Tools:** Set reminders, manage to-do lists, and track your progress toward personal goals.
  * **Integrated Reminders:** Trigger custom reminders based on your schedule and habits, ensuring you stay on track.

### 🚀 Demo

Here's how you can get started and see LifeSync in action:

1.  **Add a New Habit:** Navigate to the "Habits" section and add a new habit, like "Drink 8 glasses of water."
